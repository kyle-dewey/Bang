# Bang
Explosive hazard modeling app for android

Bang is an open source project under the apache 2.0 license. It builds graphical hazard models on google maps in accordance 
with the 60a-1-1-4. It is completely free to use and modify for military and law enforcement personnel. A user guide and
a developers guide will be added to this repository shortly. I am by no means a mobile developer. I would love for this to be a 
living project with EOD technicians from across different communities helping to build and maintain this code.
