# Bang
Explosive hazard modeling app for android

Bang is an open source project under the apache 2.0 license. It builds graphical hazard models on google maps based on blast and fragmentation modeling. 
It is completely free to use and modify for public safety personnel. A user guide and
a developers guide will be added to this repository shortly. I am by no means a mobile developer. I would love for this to be a 
living project with EOD technicians from across different communities helping to build and maintain this code. 

****DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS****
To download bang just click on the .apk file in the home directory of this project or download the apk form the project website at defusinguncertainty.org 

****DEVELOPERS!****
If you are interested in making your own version of BANG, or in translation and localization of the app send me an email and I will give you access to the source code. For translation and localization I have a fairly straight forward pipeline for building local versions.
